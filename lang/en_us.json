    "home_new_title": "Critical Changes in MC 1.21+ version of FTB Quests (WIP)",
    "home_new_desc": "[Version 2100.1.0](https://github.com/FTBTeam/FTB-Quests/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#210010) has changed the way translations are handled. The translation text is now stored in `config/ftb_quests/quests/lang/xx_xx.snbt` file, no longer requiring additional `.json` files.\n\nI am currently working on progress to support this change. You can check the progress on [this issue page](https://github.com/peunsu/mc-questing-mod-localizer/issues/33). Please be patient until the update is released.",
